# OVERVIEW

A vanilla Javascript based calorie tracker web-app. The code here demonstrates Object Oriented Programming in Javascript ES6 using 2022 syntax and local storage for data. 

It's also a great learning tool for understanding the misery of not having a reactive framework to work with for the front-end.
